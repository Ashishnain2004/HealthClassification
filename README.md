# HealthClassification
This repository contains a step-by-step guide to create a classification model to be considered to predict one's lifestyle by inputting their daily activities. There is a help assistant for any medical queries.

DL file contains the code to train our predictive model which predicts a person's health status using inputs like Daily Steps, BMI, Profession, Stress Level, etc. 

Health T5 uses a T5 small model to train our model on a dataset and work as a chatbot/chat assistant. This helps us determine the cause and doctor to whom we may concern ourselves.

There are some JSON files, HTML, CSS, and Python files that work as our end-user program. i.e., it is an online platform created to combine all the DL/NLP files and work as a working program.

# USE CODE WITH CAUTION AND MODIFY IT ACCORDING TO YOUR USE.
